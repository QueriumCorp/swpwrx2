0001 Purpose of This Repo
#########################

Status
******

**Draft**

.. TODO: When ready, update the status from Draft to Provisional or Accepted.

.. Standard statuses
    - **Draft** if the decision is newly proposed and in active discussion
    - **Provisional** if the decision is still preliminary and in experimental phase
    - **Accepted** *(date)* once it is agreed upon
    - **Superseded** *(date)* with a reference to its replacement if a later ADR changes or reverses the decision

    If an ADR has Draft status and the PR is under review, you can either use the intended final status (e.g. Provisional, Accepted, etc.), or you can clarify both the current and intended status using something like the following: "Draft (=> Provisional)". Either of these options is especially useful if the merged status is not intended to be Accepted.
